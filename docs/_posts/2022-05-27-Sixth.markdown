We have finished Room 1 as of today. Even though we plan on adding more details, we plan to prioritize finishing other rooms before working
on some of the more finer details.  

There was one major issue that we encountered near the end of the level: we couldn't let the main class/method know that the level has been beated.
Since the  ```setOnMouseClicked``` is written in the LevelOne class instead of in the main class for organization, if we were to write another 
```setOnMouseClicked``` lambda inside main, the one in LevelOne would be overwritten, thus rendering it useless. We also can't change scenes in LevelOne
class, since it doesn't have access to the stage.  

The solution that we came up with for now is to change the way that changing scenes worked. Instead of using ```setOnMouseClicked```, we used ```setOnKeyPressed```,
which will prevent the overwritting of ```setonMouseClicked```. The downside of this solution is that it disrupts the consistency of the game, which means it
might need to be improved.  

For now, we have decided to finish implementing and modelling Room 2.
