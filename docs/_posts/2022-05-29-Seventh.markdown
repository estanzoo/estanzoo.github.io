##### Author: Sean

So for the graphics I used blender to make them. 
I made the room and placed the 3d models around. 
We decided to go this way instead of pixel art, which a 
lot of people are doing, because it helps make our game 
stand out and also good pixel art is hard to make and none of 
us have that kind of skill. I had a TON of trouble with room 1 
despite it being smaller and less complex. I was still getting 
used to blender. Eventually I got into a flow and now have 
learned how to make the rooms. The second room took substantially
 less time than the first. The second room has a very bleak feel to it. 
Whereas the first room was all tidy and neat, the second room had concrete walls and
 rusted things. It shows the decline in the banana’s mental health. I have still yet 
to add the second part to the second room however.
