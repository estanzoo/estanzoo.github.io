As of today, we have finished creating room 1, with a working key as well as the ability to look around the room. 
The only thing remaining for room 1 is opening the chest using the key, meeting and talking to the banana, 
as well as leaving the room. While creating the key, we discovered that it is not possible to change the value of a 
variable in a lambda function, so we ended up going to StackOverflow and using AtomicRefernce to solve this issue.
The following is a snipet of the code:

```
AtomicReference<Integer> a = new AtomicReference<>(0);
```

This is equivalent to 

```
int a = 0;
```

Except it is able to be edited inside lambdas.
