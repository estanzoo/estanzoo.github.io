As of today we have finished the transition from Swing to Javafx. We have found Javafx significantly easier to work with and we have made
noticeable progress on our project, finishing the menu page as well as starting to implement Room 1 all in one day.  

We are looking forward to advancing further into our project next week, where we are hoping to finish implementing Room 1 and to finish the instructions page.
