##### Author: Ethan  

We have, as of today, finished all of room 1, including some additional images that we were planning to add. Even though this is quite an achievement, there are still two more rooms
to implement, which are arguably harder than room 1.

However, since we already have most of the framework done, we can just copy things over and change images to implement later stages of the game.

We plan to completely finalize the ending of the game this week so that Sean can finish the modelling. At the same time, Leo will be implementing part 1 of room 2. As for me, I will be 
simply helping both of them for any work they have as well as adding more creative elements to the game.
