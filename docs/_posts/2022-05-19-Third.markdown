As of today, *Normal Ideas* has finished styling the first room and has completed the screenshots required to implement the room in the game. 
We have also started to create the menu screen, however, we have found little success in implementing user input in the GUI. After careful
consideration, we have deicded to begin the transition from Java's Swing to Javafx in order to simplify the process going forward. There will
be more updates as to whether or not this transition is succesful or not.
