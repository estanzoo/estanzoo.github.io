There was a meeting today regarding our project's immediate next steps. We have decided to focus primiarily on finalizing ideas for the project as well as familiarizing ourselves with some of things that we will need for the project (GitHub, GUI, etc.)  
We will begin formulating the storyboard this week.

Today marks the beginning of ISP project. Our team, consisting of Sean Zhang, Leo Liu and myself have named ourselves "Common Ideas".  
We all signed a contract that lists some responsiblities that must be carried out as a team member of Common Ideas.
